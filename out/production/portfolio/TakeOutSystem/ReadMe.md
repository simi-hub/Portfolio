This package, Takeout System, simulates a 
takeout system in a restaurant 
environment. It uses basic Java and 
Programming  principles and frameworks to 
create a logic of a customer 
ordering and checking out from a 
restaurant. This folder, TakeoutSystem 
contains folders which represents various 
classes that simulate real life 
conditions of things and people in 
restaurant. It also contains test folders 
to test written code.

This project idea was sourced from 
codeAcademy, and the simulation /logic 
behind it was written by...
